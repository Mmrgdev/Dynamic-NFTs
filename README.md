# Dynamic-NFTs
This Smart Contract allows us to return live the metadata (properties) of the NFTs (ERC-721).

This can be useful for when NFTs are required to be dynamic, as in the case of a game where NFTs are required with attributes that change throughout the development of the game (for example: level, life, etc). It can also be usable for other cases, whether it is a gym pass that informs us of the days we have left to go to the gym until the end of the subscription.

The JSON is built by the Smart Contract in real time, the NFT image has been obtained from IPFS.

The overall process can be seen below:
